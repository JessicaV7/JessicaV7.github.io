    <h2><em>Background</em></h2>
    <div>
      Some basic info about me is that I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY on July 14. I was raised in a hispanic neighborhood, which is why I love my heritage so much. I am a city gal but I love to runaway with Mother Nature every summer in August and let my mind relax. I runaway to my camp which is called Steve's Camp at Horizon Farms. I go to relax but also build long-lasting relationships. Some of my favorite colors are blue, pastels, green and grey.
    </div>
    <div>
      My parents met in Brooklyn. My father is from Mexico and my mother is from a country in central america called El Salvador.
    </div>
    <div>
      I have 3 older brothers. The oldest is 24. I have 2 sisters, one older, who is 21, and the other younger, who is 13.
    </div>
    <div>
      I grew up to be myself. All my life, I have been surrounded by people who want to fit in society. I never really wanted to be a follower, so I decided to just do me because life is short and you do not want to be a follower all your life. So my personality is very open minded, weird, loving and unique, to me.

      <h2><em>Video Games</em></h2>
      <div>
      At the age of 3, I discovered gaming. My first console was the Nintendo 64. It was not mine. It was my older sister's. It was given to her as a birthday present. However, she did not seem interested in the system, so I decided to play on it. After a hour, or two, of playing some Mario, I knew I was going to grow up to love and play video games for the rest of my life. After that, until present day, I am determined to collect every Nintendo system, home and handhelds. So far, I have majority of their consoles, that all have a place in my heart, that cannot be replaced by another game company.
        However, I am opened to the video game community and love to discuss gaming prefrences, those being genre, style, etc.
        I am really dedicated to my gaming that I once dreamt of being a game developer, but that was when I was younger. But I really want to get some video game related tattoos.

      <h2><em>My Plugs</em></h2>
      <div>
        I started to strech my ears in my freshman year of highschool. I always wanted to stretch my ears when I saw my sister put her 16G plug and saw others with their more exaggerated ears. I was in awe and made it a life goal that I get my ears to that point. One of my motivaters was my best friend. We both loved the pierced life. I started with a 16G, but would speed up the process. Instead of waiting 5 months for my streched lobe to heal, I would size up in a month instead. <strong>DO NOT DO THAT </strong>, if you plan on stretching your ears. I wanted to speed it up but it is absolutely not recommended at all.
      </div>
      <div>
        So my current size is 11mm or 7/16 of an inch.
      </div>
      <div>
        The reason why I got plugs was because of my goal. But now that my guages are a part of me, they gave me confidence and allowed me to be more open with people and step out of my comfort zone(at certain times).
      </div>
      <p>
      <input class="MyButton" type="button" value="Here is where I get my plugs!" onclick="window.location.href='https://www.freshtrends.com'" />
    </p>
        <h2><em>Bunny</em></h2>
        <div>
        I got my bunny,Named Bunny Bonita because why not and she would only respond to 'Bunny' whenever we called for her.
        I always wanted to have a pet that I could befriend and have by my side for a long time, and Bunny was the perfect one. She was wonderful. She was a quick learner, which was an advantage on potty training her and keeping her from biting anything that came her way.
        I had her for 4 years, starting 2012 when she was 6 months old. She was my top priority then. I really only paid attention to her. I legit neglected my homework, which had a lot of consequnces, especially living in a Lation household.
        The day she died was the worst day of my life. I thought I was going to die myself. But I pulled up my big girl pants and faced the circle of life (though it was very diffiult ;-;)
        Since then, I got her cremated and plan to get a tattoo in her honor since she bought me so much happiness and made my dream come true.

          <h2><em>Music I enjoy</em></h2>
          <div>
          I am open to listen to anything, except gospel. But the majority of the time, I enjoy some Green Day, Queen and K-Pop. I genuinly enjoy music with a meaning behind it to relax and remind myself everything in the world has a purpose, whether we like it or not.
          </div>
          <div>
          I also enjoy a lot of EDM. My favorite artists have to me DeadMau5, Skrillex, Avicii and Martin Solveig
